# SEAL
The Simple Encryption ALgorithm (SEAL) is a 128-bit symmetric key block cipher that was designed to be fast without
any hardware acceleration. As of August 2017, SEAL is undergoing academic review, and as such is not ready to be used for a
professional application. The implementation released here should only be used for educational purposes.
